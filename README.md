## Project Description

This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess whether a survey respondent is likely to struggle with alcohol abuse based on their reported adverse childhood experiences and socioeconomic background. Key predictors include early-life stressors such as family disruption (like parental separation or incarceration) or experiences of poverty (like food insecurity).
